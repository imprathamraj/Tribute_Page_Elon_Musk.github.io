    <p align="left">Elon Musk was born on June 28, 1971, in Pretoria, South Africa, to Maye Musk, a model and dietitian, and Errol Musk, an electromechanical engineer and property developer. He has a younger brother and sister and comes<br> from a wealthy family background. As a child, he was introverted and showed an early interest in computing and video games, teaching himself programming at a young age. At the age of twelve, he sold a game he created called <br>Blastar for $500.

        Musk attended several schools in South Africa before moving to Canada in 1989. He briefly attended the University of Pretoria before moving to Canada, where he lived with relatives and worked odd jobs.<br> He eventually enrolled at Queen's University and later transferred to the University of Pennsylvania. At UPenn, he pursued a Bachelor of Arts degree in physics and a Bachelor of Science degree in economics from the <br>Wharton School. During his time at the university, he hosted house parties to help pay for tuition and developed a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service.
        
        In 1994, Musk had internships at energy storage startup<br> Pinnacle Research Institute and Palo Alto-based startup Rocket Science Games while in Silicon Valley.He was also accepted to a PhD program at Stanford University but decided to join the internet boom instead. He dropped out<br> of the program and applied for a job at Netscape, although he never received a response.
        
        Throughout his early life and education, Elon Musk demonstrated his passion for technology and innovation, setting the stage for his <br>future endeavors in entrepreneurship and space exploration.
