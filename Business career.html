    <p align="left">Elon Musk is a business magnate and investor known for his involvement in various companies and ventures. He co-founded Zip2, an Internet city guide software company, which was later acquired by Compaq for $307 million.<br> He also co-founded X.com, which merged with Confinity to become PayPal, acquired by eBay for $1.5 billion. Musk founded SpaceX, a spaceflight services company, and developed the Starlink constellation for satellite Internet<br> access.

        Musk joined Tesla, Inc. as CEO and product architect after leading an investment round and has played a significant role in the development of electric vehicles. He also provided funding for SolarCity, later acquired by<br> Tesla to become Tesla Energy. Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup, and founded The Boring Company to construct tunnels for high-speed transport.
        
        In 2022, Musk purchased Twitter for $44 billion and <br>took on the role of CEO. He launched xAI, an AI company, in 2023. Musk's leadership style is characterized as micromanaging and demanding long working hours, with a mix of praise and impulsiveness in decision-making.<br>
