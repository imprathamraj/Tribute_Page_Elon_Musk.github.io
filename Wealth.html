    <p align="left">Elon Musk's net worth has seen significant fluctuations over the years. He made $175.8 million from the sale of PayPal to eBay in 2002 and first appeared on the Forbes Billionaires List in 2012 with a net worth of $2 billion. <br>His wealth soared in 2020, reaching $185 billion in January 2021, making him the world's richest person, surpassing Jeff Bezos. By November 2021, his net worth crossed $300 billion, but by December 2022, he experienced <br>the largest loss of personal fortune in history, losing $200 billion due to declining Tesla stock.

        The majority of Musk's wealth, around 75% in November 2020, came from Tesla stock, but this proportion decreased to about 37% <br>by December 2022 after selling nearly $40 billion in company shares since late 2021. Musk doesn't receive a salary from Tesla; instead, his compensation is tied to the company's valuation and revenue, and he only receives it <br>if specific market values are reached. Between 2014 and 2018, Musk paid $455 million in taxes on $1.52 billion of income, but according to ProPublica, he paid no federal income taxes in 2018. He claimed his 2021 tax<br> bill was estimated at $12 billion based on the sale of $14 billion worth of Tesla stock.
        
        Musk has mentioned that he considers himself "cash poor" and isn't interested in material possessions. He has pledged to sell most<br> of his physical possessions and has defended his wealth by stating that he is accumulating resources for humanity's expansion into space.
