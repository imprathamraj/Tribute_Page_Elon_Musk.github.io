    <p align="left">Elon Musk has a diverse personal life, having resided in California for many years before moving to Texas in 2020. He revealed that he has Asperger's syndrome during his hosting of Saturday Night Live in 2021 and is a<br> practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu.

        In terms of relationships, Musk has been married twice and divorced twice, with his first wife being Canadian author Justine Wilson, with whom he had five children. He then married and <br>divorced English actress Talulah Riley twice. In 2018, he began dating Canadian musician Grimes, and they have two children together. Musk also had twins with Shivon Zilis, a director at Neuralink, and faced allegations of<br> an affair with Nicole Shanahan, the wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin, leading to their divorce.
        
        In May 2022, allegations of sexual misconduct against Musk were published, which he denied and accused of being <br>politically motivated. In April 2023, the government of the US Virgin Islands sought to subpoena Musk for documents in a lawsuit involving JPMorgan Chase and Jeffrey Epstein's sex trafficking operation.
        
        Throughout <br>his personal life, Musk's relationships and legal matters have been subject to media attention and speculation.
